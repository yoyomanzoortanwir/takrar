[["index.html", "Takrar Section 1 Introduction 1.1 Intentions 1.2 Seeking knowledge", " Takrar Sumeed Manzoor last compiled on 2021-10-20 17:05:19 Section 1 Introduction 1.1 Intentions This is a lengthy topic, and not one I can do justice to with my limited amount of knowledge and in the time I have to write this. Indeed, renewing intentions is a continuous and iterative exercise, and perhaps this sections should be similarly continuously revised. For now, I will repeat what Mufti Azeem shared on the 8/17/21 Tuesday night tafseer. While seeking and attaining knowledge, we should have several key intentions: To remove all bad desires We make du’a that the topic we’re learning will provide solace to difficulties we are dealing with in our life We act on what we learn and teach it to others 1.2 Seeking knowledge العلم بلا عملٍ كالشجرة بلا ثمرٍ Knowledge without action Is like the tree that doesn’t bear fruit علم is composed of two things: knowledge and action. To attain علم, tarbiyya is extremely important. Imam Shafi’i narrates this poem about the advice of his teacher, Waki’i: شَكَوْتُ إلَى وَكِيعٍ سُوءَ حِفْظِي فَأرْشَدَنِي إلَى تَرْكِ المعَاصي وَأخْبَرَنِي بأَنَّ العِلْمَ نُورٌ ونورُ الله لايؤتى لعاصي I complained to Waki’ about my memory He advised me to leave my sins He advised me that it is because knowledge is a light And the the light of Allah ﷻ does not come to a sinner Imam Malik says: العلم و الحكمة نور يهد الله به من يشاء و ليس كثرة المسائل Knowledge and wisdom are light that Allah ﷻ uses to guide who he wills and they are not answering a lot of questions The purpose of seeking knowledge is not to be able to answer difficult questions people ask of us, or to argue against others. It is a light that we pray guides us to find nearness to Allah ﷻ.

He was of such character and piety that when sheikh Abdul Fattah, a renowned Syrian scholar, asked Maulana Shabiq (the principal of Darul Uloom Zakariyya) about awliyah he could visit, Maulana Shabiq referred Qari Siddique Bandwi. Sheikh Abdul Fattah traveled all they way to the small city of Baanda to visit him. Another incident regarding Qari Bandwi is when he was collecting donations for a madrasa in baanda. He was taking the train home late at night in the remote village, bringing with him the bag of funds he collected, when a group of thieves stopped him and staged a stick up. They told him to leave the money, but Qari Bandwi said he can’t give the money since it did not belong to him. The thieves did not care and wanted the money anyway, so Qari Bandwi threw them the bag and said, “let’s see how far you go.” The next day, someone came to Qari Bandwi and said there are people in the city looking for him. It was the robbers; they were unable to make their escape ― it was like there was an invisible barrier preventing them from leaving the city. 3.1.2 The concept of فيض فيض Hans Wehr flood, inundation, deluge; emanation; superabundance, plenty, copiousness, abundance; stream معنى إصطلاح The internal Nur, from a heart Abu Bakr, one of the awliyah in Chicago, had said (paraphrased), “There are two steps for a Mu’min to take. The first step is to squash the nafs, the second is to enter paradise. I have taken the first step, and I am waiting for the second.” He had also said “The one who cannot benefit from the silence of the Ulamah will not benefit from their speech.” This is the concept of فيض. It is the moment when Angel Jibreel hugged Nabi ﷺ tightly in the cave of Hira. It is the feeling of spiritual rejuvenation felt in the presence of the awliyah. It is part and parcel to why the Islamic tradition emphasizes attainment of knowledge from scholar to student in an intimate manner, where knowledge is not just information but an exercise in connecting heart-to-heart. We hope and pray that in this manner, by staying close with those who are close to Allah ﷻ, we too can get closer to Allah ﷻ. One of the scholars would invite the students to his house from Asr to Maghrib, and offer them tea. They would not say anything in that time, just sit and do Adhkar. Just by sitting in the presence of the scholar, the students could find benefit in their own spiritual growth. 3.1.3 Miracles In the story of the theives and Qari Siddique Bandwi, the supernatural incident where the thieves were unable to leave the city due to an invisible barrier they felt is an example of a كرامة. معجرة is the supernatural phenomenon for a prophet. إعجاز is literally something inimitable and wondrous. For example, Rasulullah ﷺ splitting the moon, or Musa (AS) splitting the sea. كرامة is where a supernatural incident happens at the hands of a wali of Allah ﷻ. It honors the wali and proves their nearness to Allah ﷻ. Every كرامة is a معجرة of their prophet because they would not happen without the wali following the sunnah of their prophet. إرحاص a supernatural phenomenon done by a kuffar to deceive others. إستدراج a supernatural phenomenon that deceives oneself. It is literally to get reeled in. For example, fir’aun seeing the sea split believed that it was his ability that led to the sea being split, but it was not his ability, it was Musa (AS). By fooling himself, fir’aun found greater conviction in his ضلال. إستدراج is extremely important for us to be aware of. درج means levels, and إستدراج works in levels, step by step people fall of the deen. For example, if someone is doing da’wah on youtube, and they start to gain a significant following, to be wary of إستدراج means to realize that the popularity could be a test of one’s ego. We see this wariness among the Sahaba. During the khilafa of Umar (RA), he saw the Masjid filled with gems, and gold, and riches. The Muslims were joyful, but Umar (RA) was sad. He asked if this was a blessing, why was it not given to Rasulullah ﷺ or Abu Bakr (RA)? He realized that the blessing given to him and the Muslims was a test. Another example is Sulaiman (AS). The ayah in the Qur’an discusses this (27:40): قَالَ ٱلَّذِى عِندَهُۥ عِلْمٌ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَن يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ ۚ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهُ مُسْتَقِرًّا عِندَهُۥ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّى لِيَبْلُوَنِىٓ ءَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ ۖ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِۦ ۖ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّى غَنِىٌّ كَرِيمٌ Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!” Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: “This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!” In summary, whenever there is a fadhal from Allah ﷻ, we should be grateful and aware that these things are a test. 3.1.4 Difficulties in memorizing Imam Zaid Shakir said that when joined Madrasa, he was about 29. He spent an entire day memorizing the first line of his Nahw lesson. At the end of the day, he found that he forgot that single line he spent the entire day memorizing. He spent days and days on that single line. It takes time to learn and memorize, and there will be times where it seems difficult or even impossible. But it is important to remember that Allah ﷻ chose us to be here, and it is by his will that we remember anything and his will that we forget, and we just need to put our most sincere and best effort forward in hopes that He will accept our efforts. 3.2 أحاديث 3.2.1 Intentions See the section in the home page for a more general discussion on intention. It is of utmost importance to be sincere in our intentions. Through a noble intention, a small action becomes heavy in the scales, and through a bad intention a huge action becomes light in the scales. tamlul mizan - scales are by weight, not number 3.2.2 حديث ١ 3.2.2.1 حديث الدين النصيحة The Religion (Islam) is to act with sincerity (Muslim) Click here to view Hans Wehr definition for نصح 3.2.2.2 الخلاصة لزاد الطالبين The word nasiha is a difficult word to translate into English. It encompasses many things such as acting with sincerity and honesty giving good advice enjoining towards good desiring good 3.2.2.3 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي 3.2.2.3.1 Hadith commentary The word نصح: نصحة الثوب a man sewing his clothes نصحة العسل to purify honey from wax What is the connection between these and well wishing? For 1, if there is a tear in clothes, you tie and sew it to fix it and make it whole and beautiful again. The Deen is like this for tears in relationships between people. The ال on نصيح makes it a صفة, it tells us the significance of it. You cannot be on the Deen without being a well wisher. According to the ulama, this Hadith constitutes \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of Deen. Imam Nawawi said this is 100% of Deen. The the rest of the Hadith, the sahaba ask Rasulullah ﷺ “لمن?” Rasulullah ﷺ said “For Allah ﷻ, His Book, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims, and the common people.” This Hadith is structured with a purposeful order to the entities to which نصيحshould be given to. For Allah ﷻ This means to obey and believe in Allah ﷻ. For His Book This means to believe in the Qur’an and that no one but Allah ﷻ revealed it. It means to recite it as it is meant to be recited and to heed the messages it tells us. For His Messenger This means to honor him before and after his life, to replicate his Sunnah, to defend and love him and his family and his companions For this leaders of the Muslims This refers to the Muslim government and the scholars, since both are leaders of the Ummah (although a khalifa does not exist in the present day). This means to obey them and assist them, and to gently guide them when they make mistakes. Just like the blind spots of a car that are covered by the rear view mirrors, the Muslims should be covering the blind spots of their leaders. It also entails not demanding anarchy and encouraging Muslims to follow their leaders (protest, when justified, is warranted, but unwarranted rebellion and intentionally causing dissent is not). Also, given the order of things the Hadith conveys, obeying Allah ﷻ is more important than anything else, so if there is something the leaders are asking of the people are asking that is against the Deen, it is more important to obey Allah ﷻ. 3.2.2.3.2 The etiquette of giving and receiving advice Ikhlaas Advice should be given out of sincerity, not with the intention to disgrace. To be a well wisher means to not call people out in a bad way, to tell them privately, to talk with sincerity and gently. It also entails starting from a soft place, a place of friendliness. It is never a good idea to be uncongenial and caustic in how we approach people, even with the intent of correcting someone. When a cook would cook in the past, it would take a long time to start the fire, and short time to cook the meat. For example, there was a time when Rasulullah ﷺ was praying Salah, and before he got up from Rukuhsomeone ran to join the Saff and said Allahuakbar while running to catch the Ruku. Rasullah ﷺ tells him “May Allah ﷻ increase you, but don’t repeat this mistake.” He ﷺ begins with praise and recognizing the good intent in the Sahabi that he had so much desire to catch the ruku. Don’t hide naseeha Nabi ﷺ said there are 6 rights of a Muslim on another. One of them is to give advice whenever he asks for advice. If someone asks about a person for marriage, or a school, or a business they are interested in, etc., and they come to consult you because you have some experience or expertise, you should give the full advice. If it is related to a person, such as about a person with the intent of marriage, you can speak without backbiting by saying something like “it’s not a good match.” There’s no need to give detailed reasons if it leads to backbiting. Giving naseeha in a proper manner As mentioned above, gentleness when giving advice is essential. Leave out harshness and hardness and use wisdom in how you approach or respond to a person. In Surah Naml, ayah 125: ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَـٰدِلْهُم بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ Invite (people) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good counsel. And argue with them in the best of manners. Surely, your Lord knows best the one who deviates from His way, and He knows best the ones who are on the right path. Mufti Taqi Usmani Give advice in secrecy/privately Imam Shafi has a poem: If you want to give me advice, give it in private Because advice in public is reprimanding 3.2.3 حديث ٢ 3.2.3.1 حديث الدعاء مخ العبادة Supplication is the essence of worship (Bukhari) 3.2.3.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Begging Allah ﷻ means you are a believer. Why would you knock on a door when you know no one’s there? As Iman grows, the duas become longer and more sincere, since it reflects conviction in Allah ﷻ. If you were on a TV show were they give you the option of 5, 10, or 20 minutes to grab anything you want from Best Buy for free, would you choose 5 minutes? Of course, to grab as much as possible, one would choose 20 minutes. It is foolish to pick less time if you are aware there is a reward. Dua begins with praise of Allah ﷻ, e.g. through Al-Fatihah, duas from the morning &amp; evening duas booklet, or names of Allah ﷻ. Then, we make salawat. We begin with issues we are facing acutely, such as in the moment or in the 1-year program, then ask for the future, then for parents, teachers, family, classmates, etc. then we ask for our entire life, the grave, the afterlife. Finally, we end with salawat and praise of Allah ﷻ. 3.2.4 حديث ٣ 3.2.4.1 حديث المرء مع من أحب A person will be with whom he loves (Bukhari, Muslim) 3.2.4.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي According to Anasؓ, there was no day happier after accepting Islam than when this Hadith was revealed. A Sahabi came to Rasulullah ﷺ complaining, that ‘When I am with you I feel good, but once I leave you I lose myself until I come running back to you. How will I be once you pass away? Your level in Jannah will be so much higher, I will never see you again.’ Rasulullah ﷺ was silent for a bit, and then the ayah was revealted, According to a poem, “Love the pious, for even if you are not amongst them inshallah Allah will grant you piety.” 3.2.5 حديث ٤ 3.2.5.1 حديث الأناة من الله و العجلة من الشيطان Calmness and patient deliberation is from Allah ﷻ and haste is from Satan (Tirmidhi) 3.2.5.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي We attribute all good to Allah ﷻ. We should hurry to do good Deen, as this type of hurry is not from Shaytaan. Our niyyah must be correct — to hasten towards good, but to be calm and collected while doing good. An example of hastening incorrectly is in context of marriage. It is a huge decision, so one should not rush into it. Decisions like these should not be based on the immediate need, and requires thought about the future, especially with respect to how it will affect our Deen, our afterlife, and our progeny. In the surah Isra ayah 11, عجلة is used to show how we hasten towards evil. وَيَدْعُ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ بِٱلشَّرِّ دُعَآءَهُۥ بِٱلْخَيْرِ ۖ وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ عَجُولًا Man prays for evil like his prayer for good, and man is so hasty. Mufti Taqi Usmani 3.2.6 حديث ٥ 3.2.6.1 حديث المجالس بالأمانة Gatherings are to be kept in confidence (Abu Dawud) 3.2.6.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي What happens in a majlis stays in the majlis. Any private conversation must be kept secret. The only possible exception is where someone says they are going to do something to harm themselves or the Ummah, in which case you must do what you can to get them help or prevent the evil from happening, if there is intent for evil. 3.2.7 حديث ٦ 3.2.7.1 حديث الحياء شعبة من الإيمان Modesty is a branch of faith (Bukhari, Muslim) 3.2.7.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي ما عندنا خطبة لهذ الحديث 3.2.8 حديث ٧ 3.2.8.1 حديث الخمر جمّاع الإثم Alcohol constitutes many sins (Razin) 3.2.8.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Click here to view Hans Wehr definition for عقل Click here to view Hans Wehr definition for خمر عقل (reason, rationality) ties you from doing wrong and harmful things. When drunk, the mind is unable to make decisions. خمر is a shroud or a cloak, it masks عقل and covers the mind. It releases the restrictions on doing haram and evil actions. A person is asked, would you murder? He responds, “No.” Would you commit Zina? “No.” Would you steal? “No.” Lie. “No.” Eat Haram? No.\" Drink? “Sure.” The man drinks, then commits all of the above. خمر is any intoxicant that alters the mind. 3.2.9 حديث ٨ 3.2.9.1 حديث المؤمن غرّ كريم والفاجر خبّ لّئيم A believer is simple and noble and a transgressor is deceitful and ignoble (Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi) 3.2.9.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي If someone is at an airport, and the for Salah comes and he pays extra for a janimaz. He knows he is getting ripped off, but he does not mind since he desires to pray on a janimaz. It seems like he is getting deceived, but in reality he has higher priorities for which he sacrifices for, just like if a person was starving and offered food for an exorbitant price, he would pay the price for his survival. There are also people who seem like they are getting deceived, but in reality are generous. In another Hadith, it comes that a believer does not get bit twice from the same hole, but this is not applicable to deliberate generosity, where a person knows he is getting deceived but continues to give out of generosity. 3.2.10 حديث ٩ 3.2.10.1 حديث الظلم ظلمات يوم القيامة Oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgement (Bukhari) 3.2.10.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Believers will have noor rushing in front of them. Oppressors and disbelievers will have layers of darkness. An “oppressor” is a general term for someone that takes the right of something else. It is better to be the oppressed than the oppressor. What is ظلم? ظلم — وضع شىء في غير محله Putting something in the wrong place For example, putting your glasses on your feet, or your shoes on the desk. ظلم can be done to oneself. People were put on earth for a reason, so to go against it is ظلم. The limbs have certain purposes for which they were given to us, so to use them for sinning is ظلم since that is not the reason for which they were created. Furthermore, by committing sins, one oppresses oneself by putting themselves into hell. There is no greater ظلم than shirk, however. No matter how many rights of the people are transgressed, the worst ظلم is to deny Allah ﷻ or His oneness since that is a transgression of His rights. In humanism, it is often claimed that all that matters is how we treat others and social justice. But no one cares if you are praying. This is ظلم to yourself and to Allah ﷻ. 3.2.11 حديث ١٠ 3.2.11.1 حديث الدنيا سجن المؤمن وجنّة الكافر The world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the disbeliever (Muslim, Tirmidhi) 3.2.11.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي A non-Muslim cobbler is sitting on a street, while a scholar on a fancy horse comes by. The cobbler says something under his breath, so the scholar turns around and inquires, “What did you say?” The cobbler says, “You don’t even follow what your Prophet is saying,” and he quotes this Hadith, and continues, “look how rich you are and how poor I am. You’re living in a Jannah while I live in a prison.” The scholars ponders and responds, If I die in the state of Iman and Allah ﷻ is pleased with me, then the paradise that awaits me is so luxurious that the life on earth will be so terrible in comparison it will seem like a prison. If you disbelieve, then even if life on earth is terrible, Jahannum will be so much worse. A believer is in a prison because he is not free to do what he wants. Prison has a warden, you sleep when you are told, eat what you are told to eat, do what you are told to do. Every aspect of life is controlled. Life outside the prison is free — a kafir can do whatever, nothing will stop him because he does not believe in the consequences and accountability in the eyes of Allah ﷻ. 3.2.12 حديث ١١ 3.2.12.1 حديث اليد العليا خير من اليد السفلى The upper [giving] hand is superior to the lower [taking] hand (Bukhari, Muslim) 3.2.12.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Giving is much better than taking. If bringing a gift for an elder, it should be given with the hand under the gift. When giving, do not mention the favors you have done for them; do not count favors. Do not give something then start saying stuff like, “Remember how I gave you this this time and that that time.” 3.2.13 حديث 3.2.13.1 حديث 3.2.13.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي 3.2.14 حديث ١٣ 3.2.14.1 حديث الجرس مزامير الشيطان Bells are the flutes of Satan (Muslim) 3.2.14.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Some South African car jackers were interviewed once, “How do you commit such atrocious murders and evil deeds?” They said we take drugs. It alters their mind, which enables them to do extremely evil action. When the Saudi government conspired to kill Jamal Kashari, they set up an elaborate plan to remove accountability. In the end, the murderer was identified, and when he was asked how he could do something so atrocious as sawing off the limbs of Jamal as he died, he said “I just put music on and zoned out, and did my job.” When Rasulullah ﷺ would recite Quran, people would say this is so beautiful it could not have been written by a man but a greater being. Music is so evil, it is like it is written by the devil himself. 3.2.15 حديث ١٤ 3.2.15.1 حديث الطعام الشاكر كالصائم الصابر The one who eats and is thankful is like the one who fasts and is patient (Tirmidhi, Darimi) 3.2.15.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي Do not feel guilty for having material things, instead do shukr. Do not feel envious for not having material things, instead be patient. فتنة السراء fitnah of سرور, happiness فتنة الضراء fitnah of difficulty One day, Umarؓ comes to the masjid and he sees wealth, gems and gold reaching the roof of the masjid. A sahabi sees him and says are you not happy? Umarؓ responds, “No, I am really worried I cannot imagine this wealth is good for us. I cannot imagine this wealth is good if it was given while I am Khalifa and not in the time of the Khilafa of Abu Bakrؓ. I cannot imagine it is good if it was given to us and not during the time of Rasulullah ﷺ.” Perhaps the good we are given in this world, should we not be grateful for it, will only take away what reward we would have gotten in the Akhirah. In surah Ahqaf ayah 20, Allah ﷻ says: وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـٰتِكُمْ فِى حَيَاتِكُمُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ And the day the disbelievers will be presented before the Fire, (it will be said to them,) “You have consumed your good things in your worldly life, and have enjoyed them. So, you will be punished today with the torment of humiliation for the arrogance you used to show on earth with no right (to do so), and for the sins you used to commit. Mufti Taqi Usmani Rasulullah ﷺ said, ‘I am not worried about poverty, I am worried about wealth (referring to the Ummah) because people will compete in amassing wealth.’ We sympathize with everyone besides ourselves because they are dealing with death, poverty, and destruction, but we don’t realize the test given to us is just as difficult. 3.2.16 حديث 3.2.16.1 حديث 3.2.16.2 الخلاصة لخطبة المفتي References "],["aqeedah.html", "Section 4 عقيدة 4.1 Introduction to علم الكلام 4.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument", " Section 4 عقيدة 4.1 Introduction to علم الكلام 4.1.1 Introduction to عقيدة عقيدة Theology; the basic tenets of Islam; beliefs required to have iman. علم الكلام معنى لغة: Discursive/dialectic theology; literally knowledge of speech معنى إصطلاح: rationally proving the beliefs delineated in عقيدة and disproving erroneous beliefs. علم الكلام was not a science created during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. It was developed in the centuries following early Islam and continues to today as a science that rationally grounds us in our beliefs and simultaneously helps remove doubts. 4.1.2 Syllogisms and rational arguments What is a rational argument? A rational argument is an argument that employs logic to infer a conclusion given specific assumptions. An example of a rational argument is a syllogism, which begins with an overarching premise to determine properties of something specific. A syllogism is composed of three statements: two premises, which are assumed to be true and share a common term, and an inference that logically arises. In this way, by comparing observations greater statements can be made. For example, All tigers are 4-legged creatures All 4-legged creatures are animals All tigers are animals Syllogisms come in two types, universal and particular. Depending on the specific type of logic employed, a syllogism can be either deductive or inductive. Classically speaking, a deductive argument uses a generalization, then applying it to something specific. An inductive argument begins from the observation or specific and generalizes those observations to a theory. Syllogisms originated in Greek rhetoric, but found its way into Islam and علم الكلام when the Muslims conquered Roman lands. An example of how a deductive (i.e. universal) syllogism might be applied is: Everything that exists must have a cause for its existence The universe exists The universe has a cause for its existence 4.1.2.1 Silly syllogisms Syllogisms must be valid and sound. To be valid, the syllogism must have the proper format (i.e., 3 clauses, as well as certain logic applied in each clause that is beyond the scope of these notes). To be sound, the statements must be valid and the clauses must actually be true. When syllogisms are not sound, there are some interesting results: All chimpanzees are cosmonauts Some asteroids are chimpanzees Some asteroids are cosmonauts In this syllogism, the logic is valid, but the clauses are not sound. This is easy to disprove: since it begins with a universal statement, one existing counterexample would suffice. So, if you find a chimpanzee that is not a cosmonaut, then the rest of the argument is not true.

For example, بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ translates to He (الله ﷻ) is the originater of the heavens and the earth معنى إصطلاح innovation without any source in Shariah بدعة عملية practical innovation; innovation in actions بدعة إعتقادية theological innovations. For example, denying man’s free will. 4.1.3.2 اهل السنة vs اهل القبلة اهل السنة are the mainstream, sunni orthodox Muslims. اهل القبلة are those that are within the fold of Islam, but not considered Orthodox Sunni. Generally speaking, بدعة إعتقادية is more likely to cause one to leave the fold of Ah -as-Sunnah wal-Jama’a and Ahl al-Qiblah, but there are egregious بدعة عملية that will also cause one to leave Ahl as-Sunnah and Ahl al-Qiblah (for example, praying 4 rakat for Maghrib). 4.1.4 The origin of علم الكلام Islam began in hijaz, a vast expanse of land sparsely occupied by nomads. Compared to the extremely wealthy nations surrounding the peninsula (see Seerah for more info), hijaz was relatively lacking in diverse philosophical ideologies. This is because the mixing of culture (and, through necessity, ideology) and subsequent diversity in culture requires frequent interaction with cultures disparate from one’s own, but for centuries the Arabs lived alone and untouched, without war or wealth to stimulate cross-cultural dialogue. This was the setting in which Islam was revealed, and it was not until the time of the Khalifa of Umar ibn al-Khattab ؓ that the Muslims began deeply interacting with other cultures as lands were conquered. The codification of علم الكلام truly began when bayt al-hikmah was established in Baghdad in 200 AH, and Greek works in logic, geometry, medicine, and philosophy were translated into Arabic. The inculcation of useful methods from philosophies yet unknown to the Muslims (and leaving that which is harmful from the associated cultures) is cornerstone to how غلم الكلام functions — by taking methods such as syllogisms from other cultures (in this case, the Greeks) and effectively applying them to further deepen and (rationally) ground the tenets of Aqeedah. However, it is always critical to remember that the inculcation of new ideas to further seek understanding in Islam and Aqeedah must be done properly — the improper understanding and application of rational thought can easily lend itself to bid’ah i’tiqaliyyah, as we see in the Mu’tazilah. 4.1.5 Mu’tazilah These are a group of people that took Hellenistic (Greek) arguments and incorporated them into Aqeedah. The were theological rationalist, they gave preference to rationality (غقل) over text (نقل). Through their effective oratory and debating skills, they became close to the Abbasid Caliphates who are convinced by their arguments and adopt their ideas. The Caliphs begin to enforce Mu’tazilah creed on the Muslims and began an inquisition. They would ask a question, “Is the Qur’an created or not created?” Many ’Ulama were persecuted, including Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmed ؒ stood firm against the Mu’tazilah, despite being whipped and thrown in jail. In fact, one time while he was being whipped a theif passed by and says “I was whipped, yet I would still steal. You are being whipped for telling the truth, so persevere.” This inquisition lasted for 15 years, and was ended by Caliph Mutawakkil. Mutawakkil was a huge fan of Imam Ahmed ؒ, and freed him from jail. The Mu’tazili influence ends at this time (around 228 هـ), but it remains in some intellectual circles. They are considered outside of Ahl as-Sunnah, but are still Ahl al-Qiblah. It was not much later that Imam Abu al-Hasan ’Ali al-Ash’ari (d.324 هـ) and Imam Abu Mansur Muhammad al-Maturidi (d.332 هـ) would revolutionize علم الكلام. They paved the path for how rationality and Islamic text should work together, and their approaches complimented each other. 4.1.6 Codification of علم الكلام To understand how علم الكلام becomes علم الكلام, we must first understand how Aqeedah became codified, starting with Imam Abu Hanifa. Imam Abu Hanifa (d.150 هـ) was a Tabi’een. He met 5 Sahaba, most famously Anas bin Malikؓ. He was born and raised in Kufa, Iraq. This was the city the Abdullah bin Masudؓ was sent to by Umarؓ to teach Islam. Thus, many transmissions for Imam Abu Hanifa go through him. Figure 4.1: Imam Hanifa was from Kufa, Iraq. Imam Abu Hanifa began his career as a silk trader. He was advised by Imam Shabi to study deen. He begins in علم الكلام and later switches to fiqh. He wrote several books. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi takes all the books of Imam Abu Hanifa and compiles it. He rationalizes a lot of it and defends it against the erroneous beliefs of the time. And thus, we see how both precedence and علم الكلام work hand in hand in our tradition. Aqeedah is delineated by Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Maturidi explicates it, and in the generations and generations following ’Ulama continue to rationalize and defend it. 4.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument 4.2.1 Epistemology 4.2.1.1 Definition epistemology the study of knowledge; how you know what you know What are the sources of knowledge (click on them for more information)? sensory perception To touch, hear, see, etc. Basically, knowledge that you can gain with any of your senses directly. For example, if I see a person, I have gains knowledge of the person’s existence and some knowledge about how they look. intellect Knowledge gained through some sort of rational inference. Usually, this is through proxy of a sense of some sort, but could also be combined with other sources of knowledge. For example, if I hear someone knocking behind a door, but I never see the person, I can infer from the knocking that there is indeed a person present. If I see smoke rising behind a hill, but I see no fire, I can infer that there is a fire behind the hill generating the smoke. true reports and mass testimony Personally, I have never been to Pakistan, even though my father is from Karachi. If I were to say, I have never seen, smelled, felt Pakistan, so I refuse to believe it exists, I would be declared insane. Mass testimony is when so many people can verify the truth of something that to challenge it or ignore it is tantamount to insanity.Part of mass testimony is that it requires either a lot of people to verify it or an extremely reliable source to become a valid source of knowledge. If a Christian comes up to you and says ‘I say Jesus in a dream, telling me to tell you you must become a Christian.’ Would you believe him? And why would you not? Because his dream is anecdotal, and a source of personal knowledge for him, but has no bearing on you or the masses. Revelation This is knowledge gained through wahi. 4.2.1.2 Rational arguments To begin any kind of debate, it is necessary to establish مسلّامات, or mutually agreed on principles. Otherwise, no discussion can occur. Epistemology can be broken into مشهدات observation اوليات intuitive truths Intuitive truths are self-evident. They are: universal untaught For example, “If there is a future, there is a past.” “A triangle has three sides.” They don’t require proofs. Most of the time, the definition is evidence alone (for example, a triangle is defined as having three sides, thus a triangle must have three sides). If someone argues against them, the burden of proof is on the one arguing. 4.2.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument (KCA) In the form of a syllogism: Whatever begins to exist in this universe must have a cause The universe has a beginning The universe must have an uncaused cause 4.2.2.1 Premise A Whatever begins to exist in this universe must have a cause This is an intuitive, self-evident truth, and thus this premise is sound. Some atheists may deny this, but to do so ignores basic principles of the universe we hold as self-evident. Everything we experience and know has specific causes that led to its existence, for example these notes were not typed by themselves but had a person (me) writing them out to bring them into existence (through the fadl of Allah ﷻ), and similarly everything else was brought about through a cause (e.g. a person was caused through their mother giving birth to them, a tree was caused by the pollination of another tree, and a fire burns because of the combustion of organic compounds in fuel). To deny this fact is to deny intuition and logic altogether. 4.2.2.2 Premise B The universe has a beginning How do we prove the soundness of this premise? There are some scientific explanations regarding the notion of a singularity, such as increasing entropy in the Law of Thermodynamics and observed Doppler shifts in distant galaxies. However, historically science has always fallen short in determining cosmological models, and continuously changes its conclusions, which is why many scientist do not bother to speculate on cosmology. A more powerful argument is philosophical through tasalsul (see section below), or the infinite regress of causes. The conclusion of tasulsul is that it is impossible for every cause to have a cause if there is no first cause. 4.2.2.3 Conclusion of KCA The universe must have an (uncaused) cause Now that both premises of KCA have been rationally proven as sound arguments, and given that the syllogism is valid (i.e., has proper flow), through deduction the conclusion must be true. In rationalizing premise B, we find the added clause that the original cause must be uncaused, and so while that nuance is not drawn from the premise alone, it is proven in the proof for the premises. The conclusion of KCA, and the idea of an uncaused cause, does not alone rationally prove the existence of Allah ﷻ in particular, as it says nothing about the characteristics of the uncaused cause. For example, could the uncaused cause be a chance event? The big bang could be a circumstantial event. Does the uncaused cause still exist? Does it have any power? Does it have a personality, and is it subject to the effects of the causes it caused? Through further rational arguments, Insha-Allah we can deduce these qualities, but the conclusion we have currently arrived to only proves that there is a single uncaused caused. Thus, it rules out an infinite history to the universe. It also rules out the notion of multiple gods existing at the time of creation. Interesting to note, other philosphers had reached similar conclusions. Aristotle believed in a ‘prime mover,’ (Bodnar 2018) 4.2.2.4 Tasalsul 4.2.2.4.1 A thought experiment Say a soldier has an enemy in sight. However, before he can shoot, he must wait for his commander to give permission. Before his commander can give permission, he must wait for permission from the sergeant. Before the sergeant can give permission, he must wait for permission from the president. This continues for the next person and the next person ad infinitum. The end result, if there are infinite people in line waiting for the previous person to give permission, is that the soldier will never shoot since there is always someone else to get permission from. Will the soldier ever shoot? No.There is a hidden assumption in this argument: that with every request for permission, there is some amount of time needed to receive permission. If the time it takes to get permission is infinitely small, or is 0, then would it become possible for the soldier to shoot? Here we find a conundrum of 0 seconds times infinite permissions, which alone is a contradiction. But, the assumption that causes could happen infinitely fast or in 0 seconds alone is impossible, since intuitively if something has a cause then there is a scale of time. A cause and effect happening at the same moment voids the law of noncontradiction and is an impossibility. 4.2.2.4.2 A mathematical proof Table 4.1: x y y_simplified 1 1/2 1/2^1 2 1/4 1/2^2 3 1/8 1/2^3 4 1/16 1/2^4 5 1/32 1/2^5 6 1/64 1/2^6 Note: sample data for splitting a 1 gram paper in half 6 times Let’s assume we have a sheet of paper that weights 1 gram. We take the paper and split it in half. Then we take every half and split those in half. And we continue to do this infinite times. For every increase in time, the weight of each piece of paper is halved (see table 4.1). This could be modeled as \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{2^x}\\), or \\[ f(x) = 2^{-x} \\tag{4.1} \\] Which looks like: Visually, we see that as x increases, y goes towards 0. This is seen when we take the limit of the function as \\(x\\to\\infty\\). \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^x} \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\infty\\), the denominator becomes \\(\\infty\\). At infinity, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\infty}\\). Thus: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^x} = 0 \\tag{4.2} \\] While the value approaches 0 (i.e., the limit is 0), at \\(x=\\infty\\) \\(f(x)=undefined\\). It is infinitely close to 0. In other words, at infinity y is \\(0.000 ...\\text{(infinite zeroes)}...0001\\). This is the mass of each individual piece of paper. But now, when we reassemble the paper, what is the weight of the paper? Since there are infinite pieces, it can be written as the sum of all infinite parts, or: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) + \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) + ... = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) \\tag{4.3} \\] At this point, we hit an interesting juncture. For any integer i, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}i\\) is an infinite series, so what is the sum of an infinitesimal number, summed an infinite number of times? NOTE TO SELF: FINISH TYPING THIS 4.2.3 Attributes of the creation أَمْ خُلِقُوا۟ مِنْ غَيْرِ شَىْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقُونَ أَمْ خَلَقُوا۟ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ Surah Tur 35-36 Is it that they are created by none, or are they themselves the creators? Or have they created the heavens and the earth? No, but they are sure of nothing. Mufti Taqi Usmani Where does creation come from? Let’s us an analogy. Suppose there’s a water bottle standing upright in the middle of the Masjid. How did the water bottle get there? 4 possibilities: created by nothing Did the water bottle come there from nothing? We could argue that scientifically this voids the law of conservation of mass, but as in many attempts to apply science to philosophy, this would fail (are we dealing with an open system or a closed system? That’s a can of worms not worth entertaining.). More simply, logically this does not make sense. How could a summary details here. References "],["history.html", "Section 5 التاريخ 5.1 أبو بكرؓ 5.2 عمرؓ", " Section 5 التاريخ 5.1 أبو بكرؓ The Khalifa of Abu Bakrؓ was perhaps the most fragile of times for the Ummah after the prophet ﷺ passed away. This is due to the combination of a tense political climate and the two major superpowers, the Byzantines and the Sassanids, in close locale to the Muslims. However, through the genius of Abu Bakrؓ, the Muslims survived and turned from a weak, emerging nation to the greatest empire the world has ever seen. 5.1.1 Election of the Khilafa After Rasulullah ﷺ passed away, the ansar and the muhajirun gather at the courtyard of Banu Sa’idah to elect a leader for the Muslims. The ansar wanted to nominate Sa’ad bin Ubadahؓ, who was the leader of the khazraj tribe. Abu Bakr mentions the hadith that leadership is for the Quraysh. Umar ibn al-Khattabؓ nominates Abu Bakrؓ. There is consensus in the gathering and Abu Bakrؓ becomes the first Khalifa. 5.1.2 The apostates ردَّ apostasy مرتاد apostate During the time of Rasulullah ﷺ, all of hijaz was converted to Islam. Immediately after Rasulullah ﷺ passed away, many people who were only Muslim for money, politics, or other reasons began to apostate. These apostates fell into three categories: Those that returned to idol worship Those that followed false prophets Those that claimed to be Muslim but rejected the obligation of zakat Abu Bakrؓ was firm in his stance to fight all three groups. Some of these groups of people decided to not only apostatize, but also make the Muslims their enemy out of desire to control Medina or obtaining whatever wealth the Muslims had. Those in the third group, however, wanted to only be free of their financial responsibility as Muslims. Umarؓ was of the opinion that the Muslims should be lenient and not fight those in the third group. Abu Bakrؓ grabbed him by the beard and said, “Are you courageous in jahil but a coward in Islam?” This highlights an important principle in Aqeedah. Every tenet of Islam is important. Any one tenet cannot be rejected. 5.1.3 Early Battles There are three basic moves Abu Bakrؓ makes: Send a massive army to engage the Byzantines Hide the women and children of Medina in a nearby mountain fort while the men prepare for battle Send messages to all tribes that are still Muslim to fight for the Muslims 5.1.3.1 The Byzantines The apostasy of nearby tribes posed a severe risk to the young Muslim Ummah, but they were not the only challenge. The Muslims were involved with skirmishes with the Romans in the nearby Byzantine empire in the last few years of Rasulullah’s ﷺ life, and once they knew he passed away they became a serious threat. To understand the military situation of the Muslims during the time of Abu Bakrؓ, we must first review some battles that occurred during the time of Rasulullah ﷺ between the Muslims and the Byzantines. 7 Hijri Battle of Mutah Rasulullah ﷺ appoints Zaid bin Harithah as commander. He appoints Jafar bin Abu Talib as a second-in-command should Zaid fall, and Abdullah bin Rawahah as a third commander should Jafar fall. The appointment of backup commanders was a prophecy that they would be martyred, and indeed, all three became shahid. Khalid bin Waleed becomes the commander, and he brings the Muslim troops back lest they became utterly crushed by the Byzantines. 9 Hijri Battle of Tabuk Rasulullah ﷺ leads an army to Tabuk to engage with the Byzantines, in case of an invasion. The Byzantines were not there, and no fighting occurs. 11 Hijri Usamah bin Zaid Rasulullah ﷺ gathers an army under Usamah bin Zaidؓ. Before the army could leave, Rasulullah ﷺ passes away. Figure 5.1: location of battles against Byzantines And thus we come to the situation of Abu Bakrؓ. He has with him an army built by the instruction of Rasulullah ﷺ. He decides to send the army with no time to spare, against the wishes of Umarؓ. From the perspective of the Byzantines, they know that the prophet of the Muslims ﷺ has passed away, yet they see a massive army approaching under Usamah bin Zainؓ. They believe this is an indication of strength from the Muslims. Typically, when a leader is no longer present, a nation will either immediately fall into disarray or will find strength through another leader. In either case, the time immediately following the loss of a leader is often one of weakness, especially for a new nation. So if a nation that just lost its prophet has the ability to send out a massive army the next week, they must possess significant strength and hijaz must still be united under Islam, or so the Romans are thinking. They do not have the time to entertain the alternative possibility, i.e. that hijaz is in disarray and the Muslims do not have much military might beyond the army of Usamahؓ, since to do so poses a risk of significant loss and the hedonistic Romans would not accept such a risk. Had the Byzantines realized the betrayal by apostates in hijaz, no doubt they could have supported the opposing factions, instilled strife, and attempted to take advantage of the situation and ultimately circumventing Usamah’s army. Instead, they fought defensively, while Usamah’s army could fight offensively, amassing a large amount of wealth through the expedition and returning to Medina triumphant. 5.1.3.2 Battle for Medina Meanwhile, in Medina Abu Bakr ordered the women and children to hide while the men picked up arms and hid in the Masjid and guards were stationed on the outskirts to repel attacks. In other words, the Muslims were prepared for a defensive battle in the city. Again, taking the perspective of the rebelling tribes, they believe that Medina is an easy territory for the taking. They expect a lack of unity and failing militia, but are instead met with preparedness and might. 5.1.3.3 Skirmishes throughout hijaz 5.2 عمرؓ "],["seerah.html", "Section 6 سيرة 6.1 اهل الرسول ﷺ 6.2 Chapter 7 6.3 Chapter 8", " Section 6 سيرة 6.1 اهل الرسول ﷺ 6.2 Chapter 7 6.2.1 The beginning of Islam amongst the Ansar Rasulullah ﷺ met with the people of Khazraj from Yathrib at ’Aqabah. When he shared some ayaat of the Quran with them, they exclaimed that this was the messenger prophesized to them by the Jews of Yathrib. They accepted Islam and returned to their homes to spread the message. 6.2.2 First pledge of ’Aqabah Location of the pledge of ’Aqabah, now the location of a commemorative masjid The next year, 12 men from the Ansar met Rasulullah ﷺ at ’Aqabah. They took a pledge: not to steal not to fornicate not to kill their children to obey Rasulullah ﷺ in Haqq to associate nothing with Allah ﷻ Mus’ab ibn Umayrؓ was sent back with them to teach the Qur’an and spread Islam. 6.2.2.1 The reason for the Ansar’s acceptance of Islam The acceptance of Islam by the Aws and Khazraj in Yathrib was a huge milestone — the tribes of Makkah and Taif had rejected the message Rasulullah ﷺ brought, and the Aws and Khazraj became the first tribes to accept. The people of Aws and Khazraj were more soft-hearted than their counterparts elsewhere in Arabia Unlike the people of Makkah, their tribes were free from the intolerant, aggressive, and ignorant perspectives of the Quraysh and those in Makkah. Rasulullah ﷺ himself has said, “The people of Yemen have come to you. They have the most tender manners and gentlest hearts.” In the Quran, Allah ﷻ says: Al-Hashr ayah 9 Continuous war led to exhaustion and acceptance Aws and Khazraj had been battling against each other and against the Jews for a long time. They were tired of war and desired peace. Just 5 years before Hijra, they had fought a battle of Bu’ath, and were exhausted and weary. They were neighbors to the Jews. The Quraysh were far from revelation. They were deep into shirk and avoided the messages from Christians and Jews. The Aws and Khazraj, however, were near Jews who maintained some level of connection with their heritage. The Jews were in Madinah awaiting to find their prophesized prophet. Thus, these tribes were not foreign to the idea of revelation and scripture. Al-Baqarah ayah 89 6.2.3 Strategic importance of Madinah Madinah has natural terrain protection The western side of Madinah is walled off by mountains, while the east and south had foresty plantations. The only exposed side of Madinah was the north. The Aws and Khazraj that resided in Yathrib were fierce, bold, and free. They lived alone and unmanaged for generations, and their skill in riding animals symbolized their free spritedness. They also had some blood ties to the Quraysh and Rasulullah ﷺ, as Abd’ al-Muttalib’s mother was from Banu’Adi ibn an-Najjar, a tribe in Yathrib. The Aws and Khazrah had, however, historically been opposed to the Quraysh since they traced their geneology to Qahtan, while the Quraysh are from Adnan. Thus, the acceptance of both these tribes as Ansar and the Makkans as Muhajireen meant the resolution of many years of quarrel. In summary, Madinah as the place of emigration was an important military and cultural advancement. 6.2.4 Expansion of Islam in Madinah Islam spread like wildfire in Madinah through Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr. Of those that converted, Sa’d ibn Mu’adh Usayd ibn Hudayr, the leader of Banu Abd al-Ashhal, a clan in Aws Through Usayd, Banu Abd al-Ashhal accepted Islam. 6.2.5 Second pledge of ’Aqabah The next year at the time of pilgrimage, 73 Ansar (including 2 women) came to visit Rasulullah ﷺ again at ’Aqabah. Rasulullah ﷺ was accompanied by his uncle, ’Abbas. Again, the people of Madinah took allegiance with Rasulullah ﷺ, but they requested that he leaves Makkah and comes to them. 6.2.6 Permission to migrate to Madinah Rasulullah ﷺ tells the people of Makkah to migrate to Madinah, but he himself remains in Makkah as he was not yet given permission to migrate. The Quraysh, of course, were not happy with this. They tried to stop the Muslims from leaving, since not only did these kuffar reject Islam they were so blinded by their ignorance they wished to stop others from hearing it lest they accept it. Perhaps it was out of arrogance, since they knew it was the Truth yet they refused to accept it. Of the Muslims that migrated, many had to leave behind family, such as Abu Salamah, and wealth, such as Suhayb. Those who left were: Umar Talhah Hamzah Zayd ibn Harithah Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf az-Zubayr ibn Awwam Abu Hudhayfah Uthman ibn Affan several other Those who remained included Rasulullah ﷺ and Abu Bakr and Ali, and those who were restrained or held by the Makkan Kuffar. 6.3 Chapter 8 Difference between Makkan and Madinan societies 6.3.1 The Jews of Madinah The Jews had been in Yathrib since the first century CE. In 70 CE, when Jerusalem was crusaded by the Romans and the Jews were evicted, a group migrated to Arabia and settled in Madinah. They formed 3 tribes: Qaynuqa (~700 fighters) An-Nadir (~700 fighters) Qurayzah (between 700 and 900 fighters) These tribes were opposed to each other, however, as mentioned in the Quran: 2 84 At the time of Rasulullah ﷺ, Banu an-Nadir and Qurayzah hated Banu Qaynuqa because they sided with Banu Khazraj in the battle of Bu’ath in 617 AD. Thus, while the Jews lived separate from the rest of the Arabs in Yathrib, Banu an-Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa forced Banu Qaynuqa to the outskirts of Madinah. At the time of the battle of the trench in 627 CE, the Jewish tribes were located in the southeast corner of Madinah. 6.3.1.1 Religious affairs of the Jews The Jews passed down knowledge in seminaries called midra, where they taught religious and secular sciences. They prayed in synagogues. They followed the Pentateuch, but also followed the customs their rabbis would include in their religion. While they continued their tradition of religion in some form, they were not truly practicing, as besides the fundamental tenets of their relegion they were otherwise indistinguishable from their polytheist neighbors. For example, they spent their time in magic and soothsaying. Their most egregious shortcoming, however, was ignoring the message sent to them by Rasullulah ﷺ, in spite of the evident proof that he was the very man they were waiting for to be their prophet. They would even mock him, calling him رعنا since they were ignoring him. رعن Prophet of Mercy to be ignorant &amp; dumb. Hans Wehr to be lightheaded, frivolous. Al-Baqara ayah 104 6.3.1.2 Finances The Jews were often creditors, lending money or property. When recompense was needed, they would ask for women and men. These practices only further increased tensions between the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews were able to lend out capital because they owned the capital through usury, hoarding, and profiteering. Perhaps they felt a sense of entitlement, as the ‘ones who receive divine guidance,’ yet they were the most misguided. 6.3.1.3 Religious and cultural conditions In the beginning of this chapter, there is a quote from Dr. Israel Wellphenson that highlights how the Jews kept their religion to themselves and would not invite others to their religion. Perhaps an interesting aspect to this is again the pride of the Jews and the religious superiority they claimed to have over others. This is also reflected in their language and culture. For the former, they spoke a mix of Arabic and Hebrew, maintaining Hebrew for transmission of knowledge. Socially, they were constantly fighting against the Khazraj and Aws tribes and maintained exclusivity. However, their 6 centuries of neighboring Banu Khazraj and Aws meant that these tribes were acutely aware of Judaism, and some even became Jew through marriage or through a custom of leaving a child with the Jews if one dies in infancy. 6.3.2 The Aws and the Khazraj :–: Marib dam in Yemen These tribes are originally from Yemen. In about 145 BC, the dam of Marib was severely breached by the people of Saba, as mentioned in the Quran: saba15 Saba16 Saba17 There was also political unrest in Yemen. The Aws and Khazraj descend from the tribe of Azd, who migrated in waves to Madinah and other nothern areas (there were multiple times of unrest and the dam being broken in Yemen over the centuries, from 145 BCE until at least 6th century CE, until the advent of Islam and eventual conquer of Yemen). The Aws settled in the southeast of Madinah, while the Khazraj were north and central. The Aws were closer to fertile ground, as south of Madinah held forests and date trees, while Khazraj were in less fertile land. Banu Khazraj consisted of four clans: Malik Adi Mazin Dinar Both the Aws and Khazraj had sizeable power, but it is uncertain exactly how many were in. At the time of the proohet ﷺ, the Arabs had the upper hand after a series of battles between the resident tribes in Madinah, the most recent of which was only 5 years before Hijrah. The enmity between the Aws, Khazraj, and the Jews is seen in the incident with Sha’th ibn Qays, one of the Jews. He passed by some Aws and Khazraj together in harmony, and in spite recited poems of the past to inflame them. The Aws and Khazraj indeed became inflamed and began bickering until Rasulullah ﷺ came and settled their hearts. Such were the passions they had in the past. 6.3.3 Physical and geographical conditions As seen in the earlier image, at the time of Rasulullah ﷺ there was clear separation between tribes spatially. Each contained lands for growing and livestock, lands for living, and land for protection (fortresses), since such was the type of society they were in. The Jews in particular had 95 such fortresses. What a strange society, each tribe at each others throats, living in proximity for centuries, built in such a way that they relied on each other for survival as much as they needed to protect themselves from one another. In the Quran, this is referenced: Surah Hashr ayah 14 Physically, Madinah has several plains formed through lava. Notably, on the east is Harrat al Waqim and on the west is Harrat al-Wabarah. These plains of igneous, dangerous rocks prevent attack from the sides of Madinah.
