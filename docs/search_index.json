Indeed, renewing intentions is a continuous and iterative exercise, and perhaps this sections should be similarly continuously revised. For now, I will repeat what Mufti Azeem shared on the 8/17/21 Tuesday night tafseer. While seeking and attaining knowledge, we should have several key intentions: To remove all bad desires We make du’a that the topic we’re learning will provide solace to difficulties we are dealing with in our life We act on what we learn and teach it to others 1.2 Seeking knowledge العلم بلا عملٍ كالشجرة بلا ثمرٍ Knowledge without action Is like the tree that doesn’t bear fruit علم is composed of two things: knowledge and action. To attain علم, tarbiyya is extremely important. Imam Shafi’i narrates this poem about the advice of his teacher, Waki’i: شَكَوْتُ إلَى وَكِيعٍ سُوءَ حِفْظِي فَأرْشَدَنِي إلَى تَرْكِ المعَاصي وَأخْبَرَنِي بأَنَّ العِلْمَ نُورٌ ونورُ الله لايؤتى لعاصي I complained to Waki’ about my memory He advised me to leave my sins He advised me that it is because knowledge is a light And the the light of Allah ﷻ does not come to a sinner Imam Malik says: العلم و الحكمة نور يهد الله به من يشاء و ليس كثرة المسائل Knowledge and wisdom are light that Allah ﷻ uses to guide who he wills and they are not answering a lot of questions The purpose of seeking knowledge is not to be able to answer difficult questions people ask of us, or to argue against others. It is a light that we pray guides us to find nearness to Allah ﷻ.

He was of such character and piety that when sheikh Abdul Fattah, a renowned Syrian scholar, asked Maulana Shabiq (the principal of Darul Uloom Zakariyya) about awliyah he could visit, Maulana Shabiq referred Qari Siddique Bandwi. Sheikh Abdul Fattah traveled all they way to the small city of Baanda to visit him. Another incident regarding Qari Bandwi is when he was collecting donations for a madrasa in baanda. He was taking the train home late at night in the remote village, bringing with him the bag of funds he collected, when a group of thieves stopped him and staged a stick up. They told him to leave the money, but Qari Bandwi said he can’t give the money since it did not belong to him. The thieves did not care and wanted the money anyway, so Qari Bandwi threw them the bag and said, “let’s see how far you go.” The next day, someone came to Qari Bandwi and said there are people in the city looking for him. It was the robbers; they were unable to make their escape ― it was like there was an invisible barrier preventing them from leaving the city. 3.2 The concept of فيض فيض Hans Wehr flood, inundation, deluge; emanation; superabundance, plenty, copiousness, abundance; stream معنى إصطلاح The internal Nur, from a heart Abu Bakr, one of the awliyah in Chicago, had said (paraphrased), “There are two steps for a Mu’min to take. The first step is to squash the nafs, the second is to enter paradise. I have taken the first step, and I am waiting for the second.” He had also said “The one who cannot benefit from the silence of the Ulamah will not benefit from their speech.” This is the concept of فيض. It is the moment when Angel Jibreel hugged Nabi ﷺ tightly in the cave of Hira. It is the feeling of spiritual rejuvenation felt in the presence of the awliyah. It is part and parcel to why the Islamic tradition emphasizes attainment of knowledge from scholar to student in an intimate manner, where knowledge is not just information but an exercise in connecting heart-to-heart. We hope and pray that in this manner, by staying close with those who are close to Allah ﷻ, we too can get closer to Allah ﷻ. One of the scholars would invite the students to his house from Asr to Maghrib, and offer them tea. They would not say anything in that time, just sit and do Adhkar. Just by sitting in the presence of the scholar, the students could find benefit in their own spiritual growth. 3.3 Miracles In the story of the theives and Qari Siddique Bandwi, the supernatural incident where the thieves were unable to leave the city due to an invisible barrier they felt is an example of a كرامة. معجرة is the supernatural phenomenon for a prophet. إعجاز is literally something inimitable and wondrous. For example, Rasulullah ﷺ splitting the moon, or Musa (AS) splitting the sea. كرامة is where a supernatural incident happens at the hands of a wali of Allah ﷻ. It honors the wali and proves their nearness to Allah ﷻ. Every كرامة is a معجرة of their prophet because they would not happen without the wali following the sunnah of their prophet. إرحاص a supernatural phenomenon done by a kuffar to deceive others. إستدراج a supernatural phenomenon that deceives oneself. It is literally to get reeled in. For example, fir’aun seeing the sea split believed that it was his ability that led to the sea being split, but it was not his ability, it was Musa (AS). By fooling himself, fir’aun found greater conviction in his ضلال. إستدراج is extremely important for us to be aware of. درج means levels, and إستدراج works in levels, step by step people fall of the deen. For example, if someone is doing da’wah on youtube, and they start to gain a significant following, to be wary of إستدراج means to realize that the popularity could be a test of one’s ego. We see this wariness among the Sahaba. During the khilafa of Umar (RA), he saw the Masjid filled with gems, and gold, and riches. The Muslims were joyful, but Umar (RA) was sad. He asked if this was a blessing, why was it not given to Rasulullah ﷺ or Abu Bakr (RA)? He realized that the blessing given to him and the Muslims was a test. Another example is Sulaiman (AS). The ayah in the Qur’an discusses this (27:40): قَالَ ٱلَّذِى عِندَهُۥ عِلْمٌ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبْلَ أَن يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ ۚ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهُ مُسْتَقِرًّا عِندَهُۥ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّى لِيَبْلُوَنِىٓ ءَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ ۖ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِۦ ۖ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّى غَنِىٌّ كَرِيمٌ Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!” Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: “This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!” In summary, whenever there is a fadhal from Allah ﷻ, we should be grateful and aware that these things are a test. 3.4 Difficulties in memorizing Imam Zaid Shakir said that when joined Madrasa, he was about 29. He spent an entire day memorizing the first line of his Nahw lesson. At the end of the day, he found that he forgot that single line he spent the entire day memorizing. He spent days and days on that single line. It takes time to learn and memorize, and there will be times where it seems difficult or even impossible. But it is important to remember that Allah ﷻ chose us to be here, and it is by his will that we remember anything and his will that we forget, and we just need to put our most sincere and best effort forward in hopes that He will accept our efforts. 3.5 Intentions See the section in the home page for a more general discussion on intention. It is of utmost importance to be sincere in our intentions. Through a noble intention, a small action becomes heavy in the scales, and through a bad intention a huge action becomes light in the scales. tamlul mizan - scales are by weight, not number "],["aqeedah.html", "Section 4 عقيدة 4.1 Introduction to علم الكلام 4.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument", " Section 4 عقيدة 4.1 Introduction to علم الكلام 4.1.1 Introduction to عقيدة عقيدة Theology; the basic tenets of Islam; beliefs required to have iman. علم الكلام معنى لغة: Discursive/dialectic theology; literally knowledge of speech معنى إصطلاح: rationally proving the beliefs delineated in عقيدة and disproving erroneous beliefs. علم الكلام was not a science created during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. It was developed in the centuries following early Islam and continues to today as a science that rationally grounds us in our beliefs and simultaneously helps remove doubts. 4.1.2 Syllogisms and rational arguments What is a rational argument? A rational argument is an argument that employs logic to infer a conclusion given specific assumptions. An example of a rational argument is a syllogism, which begins with an overarching premise to determine properties of something specific. A syllogism is composed of three statements: two premises, which are assumed to be true and share a common term, and an inference that logically arises. In this way, by comparing observations greater statements can be made. For example, All tigers are 4-legged creatures All 4-legged creatures are animals All tigers are animals Syllogisms come in two types, universal and particular. Depending on the specific type of logic employed, a syllogism can be either deductive or inductive. Classically speaking, a deductive argument uses a generalization, then applying it to something specific. An inductive argument begins from the observation or specific and generalizes those observations to a theory. Syllogisms originated in Greek rhetoric, but found its way into Islam and علم الكلام when the Muslims conquered Roman lands. An example of how a deductive (i.e. universal) syllogism might be applied is: Everything that exists must have a cause for its existence The universe exists The universe has a cause for its existence 4.1.2.1 Silly syllogisms Syllogisms must be valid and sound. To be valid, the syllogism must have the proper format (i.e., 3 clauses, as well as certain logic applied in each clause that is beyond the scope of these notes). To be sound, the statements must be valid and the clauses must actually be true. When syllogisms are not sound, there are some interesting results: All chimpanzees are cosmonauts Some asteroids are chimpanzees Some asteroids are cosmonauts In this syllogism, the logic is valid, but the clauses are not sound. This is easy to disprove: since it begins with a universal statement, one existing counterexample would suffice. So, if you find a chimpanzee that is not a cosmonaut, then the rest of the argument is not true.

For example, بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ translates to He (الله ﷻ) is the originater of the heavens and the earth معنى إصطلاح innovation without any source in Shariah بدعة عملية practical innovation; innovation in actions بدعة إعتقادية theological innovations. For example, denying man’s free will. 4.1.3.2 اهل السنة vs اهل القبلة اهل السنة are the mainstream, sunni orthodox Muslims. اهل القبلة are those that are within the fold of Islam, but not considered Orthodox Sunni. Generally speaking, بدعة إعتقادية is more likely to cause one to leave the fold of Ah -as-Sunnah wal-Jama’a and Ahl al-Qiblah, but there are egregious بدعة عملية that will also cause one to leave Ahl as-Sunnah and Ahl al-Qiblah (for example, praying 4 rakat for Maghrib). 4.1.4 The origin of علم الكلام Islam began in hijaz, a vast expanse of land sparsely occupied by nomads. Compared to the extremely wealthy nations surrounding the peninsula (see Seerah for more info), hijaz was relatively lacking in diverse philosophical ideologies. This is because the mixing of culture (and, through necessity, ideology) and subsequent diversity in culture requires frequent interaction with cultures disparate from one’s own, but for centuries the Arabs lived alone and untouched, without war or wealth to stimulate cross-cultural dialogue. This was the setting in which Islam was revealed, and it was not until the time of the Khalifa of Umar ibn al-Khattab ؓ that the Muslims began deeply interacting with other cultures as lands were conquered. The codification of علم الكلام truly began when bayt al-hikmah was established in Baghdad in 200 AH, and Greek works in logic, geometry, medicine, and philosophy were translated into Arabic. The inculcation of useful methods from philosophies yet unknown to the Muslims (and leaving that which is harmful from the associated cultures) is cornerstone to how غلم الكلام functions — by taking methods such as syllogisms from other cultures (in this case, the Greeks) and effectively applying them to further deepen and (rationally) ground the tenets of Aqeedah. However, it is always critical to remember that the inculcation of new ideas to further seek understanding in Islam and Aqeedah must be done properly — the improper understanding and application of rational thought can easily lend itself to bid’ah i’tiqaliyyah, as we see in the Mu’tazilah. 4.1.5 Mu’tazilah These are a group of people that took Hellenistic (Greek) arguments and incorporated them into Aqeedah. The were theological rationalist, they gave preference to rationality (غقل) over text (نقل). Through their effective oratory and debating skills, they became close to the Abbasid Caliphates who are convinced by their arguments and adopt their ideas. The Caliphs begin to enforce Mu’tazilah creed on the Muslims and began an inquisition. They would ask a question, “Is the Qur’an created or not created?” Many ’Ulama were persecuted, including Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmed ؒ stood firm against the Mu’tazilah, despite being whipped and thrown in jail. In fact, one time while he was being whipped a theif passed by and says “I was whipped, yet I would still steal. You are being whipped for telling the truth, so persevere.” This inquisition lasted for 15 years, and was ended by Caliph Mutawakkil. Mutawakkil was a huge fan of Imam Ahmed ؒ, and freed him from jail. The Mu’tazili influence ends at this time (around 228 هـ), but it remains in some intellectual circles. They are considered outside of Ahl as-Sunnah, but are still Ahl al-Qiblah. It was not much later that Imam Abu al-Hasan ’Ali al-Ash’ari (d.324 هـ) and Imam Abu Mansur Muhammad al-Maturidi (d.332 هـ) would revolutionize علم الكلام. They paved the path for how rationality and Islamic text should work together, and their approaches complimented each other. 4.1.6 Codification of علم الكلام To understand how علم الكلام becomes علم الكلام, we must first understand how Aqeedah became codified, starting with Imam Abu Hanifa. Imam Abu Hanifa (d.150 هـ) was a Tabi’een. He met 5 Sahaba, most famously Anas bin Malikؓ. He was born and raised in Kufa, Iraq. This was the city the Abdullah bin Masudؓ was sent to by Umarؓ to teach Islam. Thus, many transmissions for Imam Abu Hanifa go through him. Figure 4.1: Imam Hanifa was from Kufa, Iraq. Imam Abu Hanifa began his career as a silk trader. He was advised by Imam Shabi to study deen. He begins in علم الكلام and later switches to fiqh. He wrote several books. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi takes all the books of Imam Abu Hanifa and compiles it. He rationalizes a lot of it and defends it against the erroneous beliefs of the time. And thus, we see how both precedence and علم الكلام work hand in hand in our tradition. Aqeedah is delineated by Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Maturidi explicates it, and in the generations and generations following ’Ulama continue to rationalize and defend it. 4.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument 4.2.1 Epistemology 4.2.1.1 Definition epistemology the study of knowledge; how you know what you know What are the sources of knowledge (click on them for more information)? sensory perceptionTo touch, hear, see, etc. Basically, knowledge that you can gain with any of your senses directly. For example, if I see a person, I have gains knowledge of the person’s existence and some knowledge about how they look. intellectKnowledge gained through some sort of rational inference. Usually, this is through proxy of a sense of some sort, but could also be combined with other sources of knowledge. For example, if I hear someone knocking behind a door, but I never see the person, I can infer from the knocking that there is indeed a person present. If I see smoke rising behind a hill, but I see no fire, I can infer that there is a fire behind the hill generating the smoke. true reports and mass testimonyPersonally, I have never been to Pakistan, even though my father is from Karachi. If I were to say, I have never seen, smelled, felt Pakistan, so I refuse to believe it exists, I would be declared insane. Mass testimony is when so many people can verify the truth of something that to challenge it or ignore it is tantamount to insanity.Part of mass testimony is that it requires either a lot of people to verify it or an extremely reliable source to become a valid source of knowledge. If a Christian comes up to you and says ‘I say Jesus in a dream, telling me to tell you you must become a Christian.’ Would you believe him? And why would you not? Because his dream is anecdotal, and a source of personal knowledge for him, but has no bearing on you or the masses. RevelationThis is knowledge gained through wahi. 4.2.1.2 Rational arguments To begin any kind of debate, it is necessary to establish مسلّامات, or mutually agreed on principles. Otherwise, no discussion can occur. Epistemology can be broken into مشهدات observation اوليات intuitive truths Intuitive truths are self-evident. They are: universal untaught For example, “If there is a future, there is a past.” “A triangle has three sides.” They don’t require proofs. Most of the time, the definition is evidence alone (for example, a triangle is defined as having three sides, thus a triangle must have three sides). If someone argues against them, the burden of proof is on the one arguing. 4.2.2 The Kalam Cosmological Argument In the form of a syllogism: Whatever begins to exist in this universe must have a cause The universe has a beginning The universe must have an uncaused cause 4.2.2.1 Premise A Whatever begins to exist in this universe must have a cause This is an intuitive, self-evident truth, and thus this premise is sound. Some atheists may deny this, but to do so ignores basic principles of the universe we hold as self-evident. Everything we experience and know has specific causes that led to its existence, for example these notes were not typed by themselves but had a person (me) writing them out to bring them into existence (through the fadl of Allah ﷻ), and similarly everything else was brought about through a cause (e.g. a person was caused through their mother giving birth to them, a tree was caused by the pollination of another tree, and a fire burns because of the combustion of organic compounds in fuel). To deny this fact is to deny intuition and logic altogether. 4.2.2.2 Premise B The universe has a beginning How do we prove the soundness of this premise? There are some scientific explanations regarding the notion of a singularity, such as increasing entropy in the Law of Thermodynamics and observed Doppler shifts in distant galaxies. However, science historically has always fallen short in determining cosmological models, and continuously changes its conclusions. A powerful philosophical argument is tasalsul, or the infinite regress of causes. 4.2.2.2.1 Tasalsul 4.2.2.2.1.1 A thought experiment Say a soldier has an enemy in sight. However, before he can shoot, he must wait for his commander to give permission. Before his commander can give permission, he must wait for permission from the sergeant. Before the sergeant can give permission, he must wait for permission from the president. This continues for the next person and the next person ad infinitum. The end result, if there are infinite people in line waiting for the previous person to give permission, is that the soldier will never shoot since there is always someone else to get permission from. Will the soldier ever shoot? No.There is a hidden assumption in this argument: that with every request for permission, there is some amount of time needed to receive permission. If the time it takes to get permission is infinitely small, or is 0, then would it become possible for the soldier to shoot? Here we find a conundrum of 0 seconds times infinite permissions, which alone is a contradiction. But, the assumption that causes could happen infinitely fast or in 0 seconds alone is impossible, since intuitively if something has a cause then there is a scale of time. A cause and effect happening at the same moment voids the law of noncontradiction and is an impossibility. 4.2.2.2.1.2 A mathematical proof Table 4.1: x y y_simplified 1 1/2 1/2^1 2 1/4 1/2^2 3 1/8 1/2^3 4 1/16 1/2^4 5 1/32 1/2^5 6 1/64 1/2^6 Note: sample data for splitting a 1 gram paper in half 6 times Let’s assume we have a sheet of paper that weights 1 gram. We take the paper and split it in half. Then we take every half and split those in half. And we continue to do this infinite times. For every increase in time, the weight of each piece of paper is halved (see table 4.1). This could be modeled as \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{2^x}\\), or \\[ f(x) = 2^{-x} \\tag{4.1} \\] Which looks like: Visually, we see that as x increases, y goes towards 0. This is seen when we take the limit of the function as \\(x\\to\\infty\\). \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^x} \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\infty\\), the denominator becomes \\(\\infty\\). At infinity, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\infty}\\). Thus: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^x} = 0 \\tag{4.2} \\] While the value approaches 0 (i.e., the limit is 0), at \\(x=\\infty\\) \\(f(x)=undefined\\). It is infinitely close to 0. In other words, at infinity y is \\(0.000 ...\\text{(infinite zeroes)}...0001\\). This is the mass of each individual piece of paper. But now, when we reassemble the paper, what is the weight of the paper? Since there are infinite pieces, it can be written as the sum of all infinite parts, or: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) + \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) + ... = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) \\tag{4.3} \\] At this point, we hit an interesting juncture. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}n\\) is an infinite series, so what is the sum of an infinitesimal number, summed an infinite number of times? NOTE TO SELF: FINISH TYPING THIS "],["history.html", "Section 5 التاريخ 5.1 أبو بكرؓ 5.2 عمرؓ", " Section 5 التاريخ 5.1 أبو بكرؓ The Khalifa of Abu Bakrؓ was perhaps the most fragile of times for the Ummah after the prophet ﷺ passed away. This is due to the combination of a tense political climate and the two major superpowers, the Byzantines and the Sassanids, in close locale to the Muslims. However, through the genius of Abu Bakrؓ, the Muslims survived and turned from a weak, emerging nation to the greatest empire the world has ever seen. 5.1.1 Election of the Khilafa After Rasulullah ﷺ passed away, the ansar and the muhajirun gather at the courtyard of Banu Sa’idah to elect a leader for the Muslims. The ansar wanted to nominate Sa’ad bin Ubadahؓ, who was the leader of the khazraj tribe. Abu Bakr mentions the hadith that leadership is for the Quraysh. Umar ibn al-Khattabؓ nominates Abu Bakrؓ. There is consensus in the gathering and Abu Bakrؓ becomes the first Khalifa. 5.1.2 The apostates ردَّ apostasy مرتاد apostate During the time of Rasulullah ﷺ, all of hijaz was converted to Islam. Immediately after Rasulullah ﷺ passed away, many people who were only Muslim for money, politics, or other reasons began to apostate. These apostates fell into three categories: Those that returned to idol worship Those that followed false prophets Those that claimed to be Muslim but rejected the obligation of zakat Abu Bakrؓ was firm in his stance to fight all three groups. Some of these groups of people decided to not only apostatize, but also make the Muslims their enemy out of desire to control Medina or obtaining whatever wealth the Muslims had. Those in the third group, however, wanted to only be free of their financial responsibility as Muslims. Umarؓ was of the opinion that the Muslims should be lenient and not fight those in the third group. Abu Bakrؓ grabbed him by the beard and said, “Are you courageous in jahil but a coward in Islam?” This highlights an important principle in Aqeedah. Every tenet of Islam is important. Any one tenet cannot be rejected. 5.1.3 Early Battles There are three basic moves Abu Bakrؓ makes: Send a massive army to engage the Byzantines Hide the women and children of Medina in a nearby mountain fort while the men prepare for battle Send messages to all tribes that are still Muslim to fight for the Muslims 5.1.3.1 The Byzantines The apostasy of nearby tribes posed a severe risk to the young Muslim Ummah, but they were not the only challenge. The Muslims were involved with skirmishes with the Romans in the nearby Byzantine empire in the last few years of Rasulullah’s ﷺ life, and once they knew he passed away they became a serious threat. To understand the military situation of the Muslims during the time of Abu Bakrؓ, we must first review some battles that occurred during the time of Rasulullah ﷺ between the Muslims and the Byzantines. 7 Hijri Battle of Mutah Rasulullah ﷺ appoints Zaid bin Harithah as commander. He appoints Jafar bin Abu Talib as a second-in-command should Zaid fall, and Abdullah bin Rawahah as a third commander should Jafar fall. The appointment of backup commanders was a prophecy that they would be martyred, and indeed, all three became shahid. Khalid bin Waleed becomes the commander, and he brings the Muslim troops back lest they became utterly crushed by the Byzantines. 9 Hijri Battle of Tabuk Rasulullah ﷺ leads an army to Tabuk to engage with the Byzantines, in case of an invasion. The Byzantines were not there, and no fighting occurs. 11 Hijri Usamah bin Zaid Rasulullah ﷺ gathers an army under Usamah bin Zaidؓ. Before the army could leave, Rasulullah ﷺ passes away. Figure 5.1: location of battles against Byzantines And thus we come to the situation of Abu Bakrؓ. He has with him an army built by the instruction of Rasulullah ﷺ. He decides to send the army with no time to spare, against the wishes of Umarؓ. From the perspective of the Byzantines, they know that the prophet of the Muslims ﷺ has passed away, yet they see a massive army approaching under Usamah bin Zainؓ. They believe this is an indication of strength from the Muslims. Typically, when a leader is no longer present, a nation will either immediately fall into disarray or will find strength through another leader. In either case, the time immediately following the loss of a leader is often one of weakness, especially for a new nation. So if a nation that just lost its prophet has the ability to send out a massive army the next week, they must possess significant strength and hijaz must still be united under Islam, or so the Romans are thinking. They do not have the time to entertain the alternative possibility, i.e. that hijaz is in disarray and the Muslims do not have much military might beyond the army of Usamahؓ, since to do so poses a risk of significant loss and the hedonistic Romans would not accept such a risk. Had the Byzantines realized the betrayal by apostates in hijaz, no doubt they could have supported the opposing factions, instilled strife, and attempted to take advantage of the situation and ultimately circumventing Usamah’s army. Instead, they fought defensively, while Usamah’s army could fight offensively, amassing a large amount of wealth through the expedition and returning to Medina triumphant. 5.1.3.2 Battle for Medina Meanwhile, in Medina Abu Bakr ordered the women and children to hide while the men picked up arms and hid in the Masjid and guards were stationed on the outskirts to repel attacks. In other words, the Muslims were prepared for a defensive battle in the city. Again, taking the perspective of the rebelling tribes, they believe that Medina is an easy territory for the taking.
